            At 16, Daniel Colaner has already achieved national recognition as an organist and pianist. <i>The Diapason</i> magazine recently named him among their <a href="/docs/The Diapason - 20 Under 30, Class of 2021.pdf">“20 Under 30” Class of 2021</a>, a select group of young adults at the forefront of the organ field. At the age of 12, Daniel captured international media attention with performances on piano at Carnegie Hall and on organ at St. Patrick's Cathedral on the same day. Since then, his talents have been showcased on <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/video/12-year-takes-talents-worlds-prestigious-stages-51397063"><i>ABC World News Tonight</i></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/GMA/status/935142383515156480"><i>Good Morning America</i></a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/8NLKsSWN2Vk"><i>The Harry (Connick Jr.) Show</i></a>, and the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05s33r0"><i>BBC World Service Newsday</i></a>. 
            <br><br>
            As an organist, Daniel has been featured on the NPR radio show <a href="https://soundcloud.com/fromthetop-1/15-year-old-organist-daniel"><i>From the Top</i></a> (Show #377), performing “Jupiter” from Gustav Holst’s The Planets, and on PBS, performing Doxology Variations with the American Pops Orchestra in <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/the-sacred-tllkhz/"><i>One Voice: The Songs We Share – The Sacred</i></a>. He was the recipient of the prestigious Jack Kent Cooke Young Artist Award in 2020 and named a 2021 National YoungArts Winner in Organ/Classical Music. He was also the 1st Prize and Audience Prize Winner in the <a href="https://youtu.be/9-djq22SO84">Sursa American Organ Competition</a> (HS Division) in 2019.

            <br><br>
            Exposed to music as cognitive therapy after being diagnosed with stage IV cancer as an infant, Daniel is passionate about promoting the study of classical music on television and radio, in addition to helping to raise thousands of dollars for music education and music therapy for a variety of non-profit organizations. 
            <br><br>
            Daniel studies organ with David Higgs of the Eastman School of Music and piano with Sean Schulze at the Cleveland Institute of Music. In addition to being an avid chamber musician, Daniel currently serves as Organ Scholar at Cleveland’s Trinity Episcopal Cathedral under Todd Wilson and as an auxiliary organist at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Canton, Ohio.
