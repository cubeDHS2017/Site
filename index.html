            Daniel captured international media attention at the age of 12 with his performance on piano at Carnegie Hall and on organ at St. Patrick's Cathedral on the same day. Since then, his talents have been showcased on <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVsM28nXa5E">ABC World News Tonight</a></i>, <i>Good Morning America</i>, <i>The Harry (Connick Jr.) Show</i>, and the <i>BBC World Service Newsday</i>.
            <br><br>
            He recently made his Severance Hall debut with the Cleveland Pops Orchestra, performing Nikolai Kapustin's Piano Concerto No. 2. Next spring, he will be performing Saint-Saëns' Piano Concerto No. 2 with the Lakeland Civic Orchestra, a work he has also performed with the Euclid Symphony Orchestra and the Cleveland Institute of Music Orchestra. As a collaborative pianist and chamber musician, his Meraki Trio was awarded 1st Place at the inaugural Glass City Chamber Music Competition.
            <br><br>
            As an organist, The Diapason magazine named him among their <a href="https://www.thediapason.com/content/diapason-20-under-30-class-2021">"20 Under 30" Class of 2021</a>, a select group of young adults at the forefront of the organ field. Daniel has been featured on the NPR radio show <a href="https://fromthetop.org/musician/daniel-colaner/"><i>From the Top (Show #377)</i></a>, performing "Jupiter" from Gustav Holst's <i>The Planets</i>, and on PBS, performing "Doxology Variations" with the American Pops Orchestra in <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsA2_4XFBmU">One Voice: The Songs We Share – The Sacred</a></i>. Daniel was the recipient of the prestigious Jack Kent Cooke Young Artist Award in 2020 and named a 2021 National YoungArts Winner in Classical Music. He was the 1st Prize winner in the Columbia AGO Competition for Young Organists in 2022, the 1st Prize and Audience Prize winner in the Sursa American Organ Competition (HS Division) in 2019, and was awarded 1st Prize in the 2021 David Spicer Hymn Playing Competition.
            <br><br>
            Diagnosed with stage IV cancer as an infant, exposure to music as cognitive therapy, combined with his love of sound, unleashed his passion for the piano at age 5 and organ at age 10. Daniel continues to actively promote the study of classical music on television and radio and has helped raise thousands of dollars for music education and music therapy for a variety of non-profit organizations.
            <br><br>
            Daniel studies piano with Sean Schulze at the Cleveland Institute of Music and organ with David Higgs of the Eastman School of Music. He currently serves as Organ Scholar at Cleveland's Trinity Episcopal Cathedral under Todd Wilson. Outside of music, Daniel enjoys computer programming, repairing electronics, playing tennis, and the company of his calico cat, Imogene.
