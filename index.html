                was chosen for The Diapason magazine’s "<a href="https://www.thediapason.com/content/diapason-20-under-30-class-2021">20 Under 30</a>," a select group of young adults at the forefront of
                the organ field. He was a 2023 National YoungArts Finalist in Organ/
                Classical Music and the recipient of the prestigious Jack Kent Cooke Young Artist Award in 2020. Most
                recently, he was the 1st Prize Winner at the 2023 Albert Schweitzer Organ Festival Competition (HS Division). Additional honors include 1st Prize and Audience Prize at the 2023 Arthur Poister Organ Competition

                Diagnosed with stage IV cancer as an infant, exposure to music as cognitive therapy, combined with his love of sound, unleashed Daniel’s passion for the piano at age 5 and the organ at age 10. He continues to actively promote the benefits of classical music and has helped raise thousands of dollars for non-profit organizations which support music education and music therapy.

                Daniel is the Organ Scholar at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, and a private organ student of David Higgs of the Eastman School of Music. When not making music, Daniel enjoys programming, learning foreign languages, and the company of his calico cat, Imogene.
